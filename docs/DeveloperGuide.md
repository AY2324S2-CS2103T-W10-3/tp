### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 00001`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete <id>")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete <id>` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows another example of interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("find name Bob")` API call as an example.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find name Bob` Command](images/SearchSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The `add` mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model`, stored internally as a `FilteredList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `ModelManager#addPerson(Person person)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the person inside the `FilteredList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how `add <name><Phone_number1>...` command works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An error will occur if no parameters are provided for the `add` command, as the command requires at least one parameter to add a new student contact to the list.

</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Input parameter representation in the add function:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilize descriptive tags such as "n/NAME", "p/PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER_1, [PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER_2]", "e/STUDENT_EMAIL", "a/ADDRESS", "id/STUDENT_ID", "class/CLASS_NAME" and optionally "t/TAG".
    * Pros: Offers clarity and ensures users understand the purpose of each input parameter.
    * Cons: Users may need to input more characters, potentially increasing effort and time required.

* **Alternative 2:** Utilize concise and intuitive input parameters, such as "name", "phone", "email", "address", "id", "class", and optionally "tag".
    * Pros: Streamlines the input process by using familiar terms, reducing user cognitive load and minimizing input errors.
    * Cons: May sacrifice some specificity compared to Alternative 1, potentially leading to ambiguity in certain cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete feature

#### Implementation

The `delete` mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model`, stored internally as a `FilteredList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `ModelManager#deletePerson(Person target)`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes the target Person inside the `FilteredList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how `delete <id>` command works:

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `delete` command will not delete any student from the contact list if the `id` does not match with any student.

</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to find which student to delete:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete student depending on unique `Student Id`.
  * Pros: Can make sure we delete the correct student.
  * Cons: Users may need extra steps to find the `Student Id` if they don't remember it.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete student depending on `Name`.
  * Pros: The user can delete the student efficiently.
  * Cons: There is a possibility that two students have the same name and the `delete` function may not delete the intended student.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit feature

#### Implementation

The `edit` mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model`, stored internally as a `FilteredList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `ModelManager#SetPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)`â€‰â€”â€‰Replaces target with editedPerson in `FilteredList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how `edit id <name><Phone_number1>...` command works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An error will be generated if no parameters are provided for the `edit` command, as at least one parameter must be specified to execute the edit operation.

</div>


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Editing an existing student contact in the student contact list:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the student's unique `STUDENT_ID` to identify and edit the corresponding student contact.
    * Pros: Ensures accurate editing of the intended student contact without ambiguity.
    * Cons: Users may need to remember or retrieve the specific `STUDENT_ID` before initiating the edit operation.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow editing based on alternative identifiers such as `NAME`, `EMAIL`, or `PARENT_PHONE_NUMBER`.
    * Pros: Provides flexibility for users to edit student contacts using more readily available information.
    * Cons: May introduce complexity and potential ambiguity, especially if multiple students share the same name or contact information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The `find` mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model`, stored internally as a `FilteredList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the `FilteredList` according to the given predicate.

The following sequence diagram shows how `find name Bob` command works:

![SearchSequenceDiagram](images/SearchSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `find` command will report an error when the `mode` parameter is not one of `id`, `tag`, `name`, `class`.

</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to represent the `mode` parameter in `find` function :**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `id` `tag` `name` `class` as `mode` parameter.
  * Pros: Easy to remember and less likely to make an error for users.
  * Cons: Users may need to key in more letters while executing the command.

* **Alternative 2:** Use `1` `2` `3` `4` as `mode` parameter.
  * Pros: The command is clean and easy to type.
  * Cons: Users may forget which number matches to which mode.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete Tag feature

#### Implementation

The `deleteTag` mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model`, stored internally as a `FilteredList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `ModelManager#deleteTag(Tag tag)`â€‰â€”â€‰Delete this tag for all students in the contact list.

The following sequence diagram shows how `deleteTag <TAG>` command works:

![DeleteTagSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteTagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `deleteTag` command will report an error when the input `TAG` does not belong to any student.

</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to represent the deletion of a certain group:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete the tag which identifies this particular group.
  * Pros: Can save the students' contact detail while deleting the group.
  * Cons: Cannot delete a group of selected people on this command.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete all the students included in this group.
  * Pros: Can directly delete a group of people.
  * Cons: If a student is also included in another group, the other group will be affected by this operation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Change Data Source feature

#### Implementation

The Change Data Source(aka `cd`) mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager` and `StorageManager`.

`ModelManager` extends `Model`, stored internally as a `FilteredList`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `ModelManager#setAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook addressBook)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the `FilteredList` according to the given address book.
* `ModelManager#setAddressBookFilePath(Path addressBookFilePath)` â€” Updates the `FilePath` according to the given path.

`StorageManager` extends `Storage`, it implements the following operation:

* `StorageManager#setAddressBookFilePath(Path newPath)` â€” Updates the `FilePath` for `StorageManager` according to the given path.
* `StorageManager#readAddressBook()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns the address book according to the `FilePath` in `StorageManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how `cd <FILEPATH>` command works:

![ChangeDataSourceSequenceDiagram](images/ChangeDataSourceSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `cd` command will report an error when the `FILEPATH` does not end with `.json`.

</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: What should we do when we don't find an existing file under the provided `FILEPATH`:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new empty file under the provided `FILEPATH`.
  * Pros: Users can create a new student contact list by using `cd` command.
  * Cons: Users may not realize that they made a mistake while typing the file path.

* **Alternative 2:** Give an error message that reports the file not found error.
  * Pros: Users may realize that they made a mistake while typing the file path.
  * Cons: Users cannot create a new student contact list by using `cd` command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 00005` command to delete the student with student id 00005 in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 00005` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Export feature

#### Implementation
The export feature is facilitated by the `ExportManager` class, which converts the currently viewed `ObservableList<Person>`
person list into a `String` which is then written to a specified `filePath` in the `exports` folder based upon the 
`FILENAME` input provided by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how `export <FILENAME>` is executed: 
![ExportSequenceDiagram](./images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when the user executes the command `export <FILENAME>`:
![ExportActivityDiagram](./images/ExportActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How should the application behave when there already exists a file at the file path specified by the user**
* **Alternative 1**: Throw an error and do not execute the command
  * Pros: Easy to implement
  * Cons: Might be inconvenient for users who have a lot of exported files and cannot remember what names they have 
    already used for the files
* **Alternative 2** (Current implementation): Sets the path to export to as a default generated path based on the 
  date and time of export and execute the command
  * Pros: Allows users to always be able to use the export command no matter if they remember which file names are 
    already used in the `exports` folder.
  * Cons: Might result in the user having files he/she cannot differentiate due to the naming format used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Import feature

#### Implementation
The import feature is facilitated by the `ImportManager` class, which converts the String contents within a 
specified CSV file in the `imports` folder based upon the `FILENAME` input provided by the user to a String 
compatible with the JSON save format used by the application. The new String is then saved to a JSON data file 
within the `data` folder as a new address book save file.

The following sequence diagram shows how `import <FILENAME>` is executed:
![ImportSequenceDiagram](./images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when the user executes the command `import <FILENAME>`:
![ImportActivityDiagram](./images/ImportActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How should the application behave if the data in the CSV file is incompatible with the JSON save file format**
* **Alternative 1** (Current implementation): Throw an error and do not execute the command
    * Pros: Easy to implement and safe
    * Cons: Might not be convenient for users who wish to import then edit the file
      already used for the files
* **Alternative 2**: Creates a blank list for the user to edit 
    * Pros: Allows the import command to always go through
    * Cons: Defeats the purpose of an import command


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Migrate feature

#### Implementation
The import feature is facilitated by the `ImportManager` class, which converts the String contents within a
specified CSV file in the `imports` folder based upon the `FILENAME` input provided by the user to a String
compatible with the JSON save format used by the application. The new String is then added to the current JSON data 
source file the application is accessing and saved.

The following sequence diagram shows how `migrate <FILENAME>` is executed:
![MigrateSequenceDiagram](./images/MigrateSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when the user executes the command `import <FILENAME>`:
![MigrateActivityDiagram](./images/MigrateActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How should the application behave if the data in the CSV file is incompatible with the JSON save file format**
* **Alternative 1** (Current implementation): Throw an error and do not execute the command
    * Pros: Easy to implement and safe
    * Cons: Might not be convenient for users who wish to migrate then edit the file
      already used for the files
* **Alternative 2**: Merge the files regardless and have the user to edit the JSON file
    * Pros: Allows the migrate command to always go through
    * Cons: Complicates the process of migrating heavily, also unsafe for users who do not know how to manipulate 
      JSON save files
